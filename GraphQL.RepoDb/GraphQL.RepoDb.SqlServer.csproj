    <Description>A set of extensions for working with HotChocolate GraphQL and RepoDb as the data access micro-orm without dependency on IQueryable.  This enables fully encapsulated control over SQL queries in every way within a Service or Repository layer of your application. This extension pack provides a significantly simplified facade to access critial elements such as Selections/Projections, Sort arguments, &amp; Paging arguments with support for mapping them to Models using built in RepoDb functionality.  It also leverages RepoDb to provide a generic, Relay spec compatible, cursor pagination/slice query api for Sql Server.</Description>

    <PackageReleaseNotes>Bump to HotChocolate v11.0.1 which now resolves a bug that we helped identify with interfaces in the initial release of v11.0.0.

Prior Releases Notes:
- Fix issue with Sort/OrderBy field not working if not also part of Selection. OffsetPaging is not working, it's still work in progress. But this release provides ability to trace log out some details for the query, execution time, etc. Also improves support for cancellation token throughout DB calls and minor optimizations and cleanup.</PackageReleaseNotes>
